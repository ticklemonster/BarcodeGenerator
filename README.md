# Barcode Generator

A component for generating barcodes using [JsBarcode](https://github.com/lindell/JsBarcode) library.

The component **Barcode Generator** will display the recordId of the current record as a CODE128 barcode. It accepts the following configuration:
- **Label** (`label`) - the title for the card.
- **Show Value** (`showValue`) - if the text should be shown below the barcode image.

That's all there is to it!
